    "# Document Q&A with RAG using Chroma\n",
    "\n",
    "Two big limitations of LLMs are \n",
    "1) that they only \"know\" the information that they were trained on, and \n",
    "2) that they have limited input context windows. A way to address both of these limitations is to use a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG. A RAG system has three stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Indexing\n",
    "2. Retrieval\n",
    "3. Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing happens ahead of time, and allows me to quickly look up relevant information at query-time. When a query comes in, i will ou retrieve relevant documents, combine them with the instructions and the user's query, and have the LLM generate a tailored answer in natural language using the supplied information. This allows me to provide information that the model hasn't seen before\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook i will use the Gemini API to create a vector database, retrieve answers to questions from the database and generate a final answer. I will use Chroma as an open-source vector database. With Chroma, i can store embeddings alongside metadata, embed documents and queries, and search my documents.\n"

For example, several patients were readmitted after being discharged with instructions to monitor for relapse, or after being discharged with only minor discomfort, and told to rest and hydrate. Some patients were also readmitted after recovering from pneumonia, or after a mild reaction to their medication. Finally, several patients were readmitted despite being discharged in stable condition, with a recommendation for a follow-up in 2 weeks.\n"
